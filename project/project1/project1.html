 <b>What Does it mean to be camp?</b>
</div>
<div class="h2">
<p>When asked to describe what, exactly, ‘camp’ means, designer Dame Zandra Rhodes finds herself at a loss for words. “I think it’s an extremely difficult subject,” she says with a laugh. “It’s a minefield.” Rhodes is not alone. Since it entered the English language in the late 19th Century, the term has been subject to various interpretations, and there still doesn’t seem be a consensus.</p>

    Susan Sontag’s 1964 essay Notes on Camp is the inspiration for the 2019 Metropolitan Museum of Art gala and accompanying exhibition. In it, the late writer and filmmaker wrote: “To snare a sensibility in words… one must be tentative and nimble.” Yet, in reading Sontag’s essay, it seems that even she was at times eluded by the deceptive simplicity of the term.

The first English definition of the term, which appeared in a 1909 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, conformed to popular, contemporary notions of camp: “ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical; effeminate or homosexual; pertaining to, characteristic of, homosexuals…” If not synonymous with stereotypical male homosexuality, it was, as per one of the OED definitions, strongly associated with it. “Camp to me usually meant, you know, someone gay with a bent wrist,” says Rhodes. “Ladies would have said that about Oscar Wilde [to whom Sontag dedicated her essay] at one time.”

    Likewise, Fabio Cleto, a co-author of the exhibition’s accompanying book, says that, “fully articulated camp emerged in the late 19th Century, and in the queer-star image of Oscar Wilde. It was Wilde’s stigmatised body,” he tells BBC Designed, “whose trials for ‘gross indecency’ in 1895 typified the ‘homosexual’, which provided a grammar of camp as a twisted form of aestheticism that largely (if indirectly) meant sexual deviance.”

    Yet camp, to Sontag, transcended homosexual mannerisms. “The hallmark of Camp is the spirit of extravagance,” she wrote in her seminal essay, which presented 58 aspects of the “sensibility.”. Among other things, Sontag described camp as being playful and “anti-serious”, as well as exaggerated and artificial. “Camp,” went her analogy, “is a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers.”
